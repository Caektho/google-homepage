Project:

To create a replica of the google home page and an example search results page with hardcoded search results.


End:
Polished HTML and CSS skills, also learned about the developer tools and how to structure things more clearly.
Interesting to see how some elements and class names were minified. 

Looked into minification but it seems to only be applicable for interpreted languages such as JavaScript, Python, and Perl.
