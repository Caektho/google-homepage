Project:

To create a replica of the google home page and an example search results page with hardcoded search results.
Dropdown menus or form submissions or hover-highlighting are not required.

End:
Polished HTML and CSS skills, also learned about the developer tools and how to generally structure things.

Learned about how and why to reset CSS styles, how hover highlighting with box shadows, underlining, and opacity etc can help create a responsive interface,  

Looked into minification but it seems to only be applicable for interpreted languages such as JavaScript, Python, and Perl.

Things to look into: Drop down menus
